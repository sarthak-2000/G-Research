# G-Research
This is the G-Research coding Assessment.

1. Run the file ans.py, which will prompt a file path to be inserted. Note: Please add complete file path, and the file should be in .txt format.
2. Please check the Final_Output_File.txt, that summarizes all the session data as required.
3. I have used .txt files for the sake of simplicity and and final_output_File will be generated in the same directory.


I have used data.txt as a form of testing data.
